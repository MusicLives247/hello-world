# hello-world
My beginning 

Good Day,

My name is ... and I am rather new to coding but have a hunger to learn.
I like to play guitar which I have been doing for about 3 years now if I'm not mistaken.
I am also teaching myself to play piano, though I'm not very good at it as yet.
I am a very kind and loving person and I would love to share that love with this wonderful community. 
I hope to learn much and pass on as much knowledge as I can.
  
    Sincerely,
    MusicLives247
